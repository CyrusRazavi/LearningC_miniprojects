A personal showcase of C programming mini-projects created while working through the W3Schools C guide.
Each file demonstrates a focused concept or exercise in C (e.g., pointers, loops, structs, I/O), highlighting hands-on practice and real code rather than theory. Projects range from simple challenges to small utilities that reflect learning progress and fluency in core C fundamentals.
